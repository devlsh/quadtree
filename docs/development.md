# Development

This agent-only handbook owns package responsibilities, shared authoring contracts, and [agent workflow](#agent-workflow). [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) owns startup authority and audience boundaries; [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) owns human contribution/setup procedures; [demo/AGENTS.md](../demo/AGENTS.md) owns the private demo; [Releasing](releasing.md) owns publication.

## Package Responsibilities

`@devlsh/quadtree` is an ESM TypeScript rectangle-indexing library. Its sole public entrypoint, built from `src/index.ts`, exposes the class and re-exported types as consumer contracts. [package.json](../package.json) owns metadata, dependencies, scripts, export/import maps, and package contents; [tsdown.config.ts](../tsdown.config.ts) owns output. Edit source, not generated modules/declarations. `prepack` builds current source; it neither runs tests nor requires an additional packing-validation gate. Refresh this projection when entrypoints or ownership change.

[README.md](../README.md) owns public examples and human onboarding. Internal modules use canonical docs/instructions/manifests, not module-local READMEs or compatibility policy copies. Public-package READMEs may document external usage/API. Preserve contribution, security, and support routes. [LICENSE](../LICENSE) grants MIT; [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is separately CC BY-SA 4.0 licensed.

## Change Boundaries

Inspect instructions, manifests/maps, relevant source, tests, and docs. Make the smallest direct durable change, without speculative layers/helpers or purity-only work. Public, persisted, or external contract changes require an explicit design decision; confirm external consumers before package-export removal. Narrow unclear/broad migrations or obtain a decision.

Change obstructive internal boundaries directly. Migrate callers, tests, fixtures, exports/maps, documented paths, instructions, and docs together, including public surfaces after approval. Old-path wrappers, deprecated re-exports, fallbacks, aliases, and old-call-site shims require persisted data, shipped behavior, external consumers, or explicit direction.

Update documented contracts through [Documentation Authority](#documentation-authority); contract-preserving cross-module work needs verification, not documentation churn. Map every changed boundary and failure path to implementation and [verification evidence](#validation-selection).

## Naming

Judge names at representative use sites. Start with the role; keep qualifiers only for visible same-kind ambiguity or caller/safety obligations. Count package, module, import, file/folder, owner/type, receiver/member, and collection context. Prefer local import aliases for rare collisions; repeated qualifiers suggest misplaced ownership or boundaries.

- Preserve domain/tool vocabulary, including tool-defined `context`. Keep implementation names private; omit construction/origin/mechanism words unless obligations differ or the factory itself is passed around. Name actions for callers and factories for results.
- Avoid vague bags and redundant `Shape`, `Data`, `Info`, `Object`, `Interface`, `Impl`. Use `Manager`, `Handler`, `Processor`, `Controller`, `Service` only for established or genuinely service-shaped roles.
- Avoid abbreviation for brevity; conventional short names require obvious context. Use named `Deps`, `Options`, `CreateOptions` for private single-owner shapes; qualify exported/competing shapes.
- Name files by role, without parent/package/factory prefixes. Prefer child folders with `index.ts` and sibling role files over prefix-bound flat families.
- Reserve `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for primitive config/protocol/sentinel values, not objects, collections, regexes, schemas, functions, or domain data. Remove `_` prefixes once used.

## Helpers And Shared Values

Keep operation-specific logic local. Inline obvious one-liners unless they name a non-obvious domain concept or remove meaningful duplication. Inspect installed dependencies and nearby modules before introducing generic helpers, primitive types, shared errors, or workarounds. Reuse contracts and migrate callers/tests, without one-hop renaming wrappers or wrappers preserving old sentinels/messages/branches. Similar syntax does not imply shared concepts, failure modes, or ownership. Promote only broadly useful, stable cross-cutting contracts.

For enum-like contracts, import the owner's value/type rather than redefining aliases. Narrow unions only for different local meaning. Preserve tool-defined rule/options/message identifiers; separate display labels from values. Rename across configuration, consumers, docs, and tests. Retire last-consumer contracts with dependent values/types, docs, fixtures, and tests.

## Imports And Public Surfaces

Resolve package paths through owner `exports`, and declared `#...` paths through importer `imports`, before reading/changing them. Keep clear relative imports; aliases/barrels must not hide ownership or avoid caller edits.

Export for actual consumers, with legitimate test seams and type-contract exceptions. Keep single-file declarations local; prefer behavior tests over test-only exports. Remove unused exports under [Change Boundaries](#change-boundaries), not through rules/tests/wrappers/findings/refactors solely enforcing internal export purity.

## TypeScript Contracts

- **Runtime validation** - Validate unknown/external or erased boundaries and invariants types cannot express; preserve narrowed types inward. Trust internal types rather than checking states requiring their bypass.
- **Class fields** - Declare explicitly and assign in constructors, without parameter properties. Use `readonly` for declaration/construction-only assignments; omit for later mutation, including framework mutation.
- **Readonly contracts** - Outside class fields and `as const`, deny readonly syntax by default. Allow readonly arrays/tuples or `Readonly<T>` only for existing readonly callers without mutation, owner-retained shared references, readonly-tuple type computation, or external/generated/framework contracts. Fresh caller-owned results, ordinary locals/helpers, assignment history, and documentation alone do not qualify.
- **Const assertions** - Use `as const` for literal/discriminant/enum-like/configuration/tuple inference. It neither freezes runtime values nor needs an ownership exception.
- **Runtime freezing** - Deny by default. `Object.freeze()` needs a named shared-reference contract requiring observable mutation rejection, an executed freeze, and matching shallow/deep enforcement. Fresh copies, internal facades, policy constants, or schema outputs must not manufacture readonly types. New exceptions need canonical/scoped documentation and focused mutation-rejection coverage.
- **Arrow returns** - Use expression bodies for one-line returns, parenthesizing objects. Multiline expressions/multiple statements need block bodies with explicit returns; side-effect-only callbacks need blocks.
- **Member layout** - Oxfmt owns layout, including short inline `TSTypeLiteral`s. Stylistic lint makes `ObjectExpression`s/`TSInterfaceBody`s with two or more members multiline; multiline literals need consistent braces/members. Do not rewrap tool output.
- **Import syntax** - Static imports except tests/documented lazy boundaries; prefer inline type specifiers over top-level `import type` or qualified import types. Tooling owns ordering; [tsconfig.build.json](../tsconfig.build.json) owns relative extension rewriting, tsdown owns output extensions.
- **Object parameters** - Use named interfaces/types, not inline object signatures.
- **Falsy inputs** - Distinguish valid falsy inputs from omission by arity/call shape, not truthiness.
- **Inference** - Infer obvious primitives on initialized locals/properties and defaulted parameters, straightforward returns, and concrete declaration/method `void`. Keep annotations defining/widening/narrowing/protecting caller contracts, including unimplemented signatures. Keep intentional arrow/expression `void` preventing narrower contracts such as `never`.

## Comments And JSDoc

Coverage follows opacity/complexity, not visibility or declaration kind: obvious exports need none; hidden private contracts do. Inspect classes/bases, builders, registries, adapters, overloads, generics, and runtime seams accordingly. Document unclear ownership, ordering/sequencing, side effects, invariants, lifecycle, errors, bounds/defaults, and caller obligations at originating declarations; export docs need a distinct consumer contract. Use short inline rationale for complex decisions, races, API quirks, casts, and cleanup.

Top-level primitive config/protocol/sentinel constants explain control, constraints, and prerequisites for lowering/removal/reuse. Replace magic trailing comments with named constants, enums, or protocol types. Avoid obvious narration/speculation; broad policy belongs in canonical docs/instructions/tests.

Preserve directive text/placement unless the tool proves changes safe. Triage `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `NOTE`, `REVIEW`, `PERF`, `DEBUG`, `REMARK` against implementation, tests, issue state, history, and tool evidence, not age/label. Retain TODOs unless this change resolves them.

Use multiline `/** ... */` immediately above declarations, purpose/non-obvious behavior first. Use prose or `@example`, not custom `@usage`; no renderer/API report is configured. Tags add semantics: `@param`/`@returns` beyond signatures, `@template` for unclear generic roles/constraints, `@throws` for stable actionable errors, `@example` for verified meaningful canonical calls, and `{@link ...}` for useful stable targets. Verify examples/overloads, links, defaults, errors, and claims against implementation/types/tests/callers. Use existing checks; report excluded-file [coverage gaps](#closeout).

## Documentation Authority

Keep durable facts in one canonical owner; link or refine compatible local scope. Use the owners above, not copied executable script/export/version/cache/action-pin inventories. Necessary projections name source and refresh trigger. Document current contracts, not dates, rollout/migration recaps, or sessions; history/issues are evidence, not authority.

Update canonical docs, examples, and onboarding routes together when behavior, boundaries, public surfaces, commands, validation, or repeatable workflows change. Unsupported/conflicting prose, weakened contracts, unsupported environment claims, or missing operational outcomes require preserving truth and reporting the needed owner/implementation/decision. Keep unrelated/out-of-scope work unchanged; offer compliant alternatives where possible.

For agent instructions, front-load activating conditions and route each branch to one owner. State positive actions with hard guardrails. Co-locate controlling source, action, caveats, exhaustive observable completion, and prerequisite/conflict/failure recovery for every branch. Commands/edits alone do not complete verification/recovery.

Limit root instructions to always-loaded authority/constraints/routes. Refresh scoped instructions/maps when ownership, surfaces, commands, or boundaries change. Use lists/definition bullets, not handbook tables; default to ASCII unless content/existing text justifies otherwise. Tooling owns whitespace/import ordering. Keep handoffs/prototypes transient unless requested durable; put durable research in canonical owners and multi-session teaching outside the root. Installed workflows cannot replace ownership, authorization, validation, or closeout.

## Agent Workflow

Follow CONTRIBUTING for participation/setup/checks/PRs within [root authorization](../AGENTS.md#authority-and-safety). Human procedures do not authorize agent mutations, staging, commits, pushes, hosted operations, release dispatch, or publication.

### Tracker Operations

For authorized tracker operations, resolve the exact hosted repository, not the package name. Follow [Questions And Reports](../CONTRIBUTING.md#questions-and-reports); link duplicates or record none found. Keep issues small/actionable, link PRs/canonical docs, centralize duplicates, and keep detailed design in canonical docs or implementing PRs. Close with a fixing PR or explicit reason. Preserve package/tool terms; report terminology gaps.

Before labeling, resolve current hosted availability and justify labels from tracker configuration and affected surface/proven cause. [Issue forms/configuration](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) route intake without assigning labels.

### Environment And Dependencies

Follow [Local Development](../CONTRIBUTING.md#local-development), including trust/revoke/manual activation, and [Dependency Changes](../CONTRIBUTING.md#dependency-changes). `package.json` `devEngines` solely authors exact Node/pnpm versions; [pnpm-workspace.yaml](../pnpm-workspace.yaml) owns installation/workspaces.

[devenv.nix](../devenv.nix) selects locked Nix major families without missing-attribute fallback or exact-version verification. Applicable pnpm commands reject mismatches without replacements; raw Node/direct tools lack a Nix exact-version guard. [devenv.yaml](../devenv.yaml) owns immutable inputs/CLI-module compatibility; generated locks are not authored version authorities. Corepack/automatic pnpm installation are disabled. Refresh projections when these owners change.

Absent release-age declarations do not prove eligibility. Stop for maintainer clarification when policy/eligibility is unresolved; never add exclusions or bypass constraints. Frozen installation runs every time, including `prepare` hook setup and cache hits. `verifyDepsBeforeRun: error` rejects missing/stale dependencies with `VERIFY_DEPS_BEFORE_RUN` before children execute. Recover through shared frozen installation; reconcile manifest/lock drift, not implicit/non-frozen installs.

[lefthook.yml](../lefthook.yml) runs generated hooks through `devenv shell lefthook`, including GUIs without direnv. Git's `PATH` needs devenv and preinstalled dependencies; hooks do not install them. Fixers may stage output; checks grant no staging/commit authority.

### Tooling And Coverage

Inspect manifest scripts/composition; keep related scripts/config/lock changes together. Use root scripts for repository-wide work, root-relative paths with `pnpm exec <tool> ...`, and `pnpm why <dependency>` from the consumer rather than assuming root links. Bounded fixers require explicit paths; pathless means repository-wide. Apply `pnpm lint:fix <files>` then `pnpm fmt <files>`, inspect scoped changes, and repair remaining/semantic findings. Format directly when intended; narrow failures instead of blind retries. Establish operational prerequisites/recovery; target CI setup to consumer artifacts.

[CONTRIBUTING checks](../CONTRIBUTING.md#checks) own command composition/exclusions. Root typechecking emits nothing; lint builds nothing. Inspect TypeScript includes before claiming test typechecking: Vitest execution does not typecheck tests. Inspect [oxlint](../oxlint.config.ts)/[oxfmt](../oxfmt.config.ts) configs and presets for file coverage; Oxlint does not lint Markdown. [vitest.config.ts](../vitest.config.ts) owns runner configuration; tests exercise the public class through `src/index.ts`.

[validate.yml](../.github/workflows/validate.yml) owns CI; [setup-node-pnpm](../.github/actions/setup-node-pnpm/action.yml) selects native `devEngines`/frozen installation with hook setup on cache hits. CI runs without Nix/devenv; local setup remains unchanged. Local workflows prove neither hosted protection/required checks nor OIDC readiness. Demo deployment boundaries belong to demo guidance; refresh projections when executable owners change.

### Validation Selection

Select cumulatively by change type and every affected interface. Repository commands override generic workflows/Jest examples; do not invent scripts.

- **Docs** - Inspect Markdown, paths/anchors, lists, and routing. Run `pnpm fmt <changed-files>`, `pnpm fmt:check`, and `pnpm check`. No independent code review is required for docs-only work.
- **TypeScript** - Focused `pnpm lint <changed-file>`, `pnpm typecheck`, and established behavior checks. Cross-module changes finish with check unless blocked/outside scope; broad migrations/refactors verify each logical batch.
- **Quadtree** - At the public seam, exercise affected insertion, subdivision, retrieval, bounds, duplicates, and clearing. Use `pnpm test -- tests` and full `pnpm test`. Assert collision candidates, not exact collisions/duplicate counts. For affected traversal, verify actual-node pre-order, empty leaves, fresh bounds ownership, exception propagation, and clear/rebuild. Demo outlines cannot replace these tests.
- **Demo** - Add [scoped checks](../demo/AGENTS.md#checks) for affected controls, simulation, resizing, traversal rendering, and lifecycle; library checks do not replace them.
- **Packaging** - `pnpm build` for changed entrypoints, output/declarations, or built consumer imports, not default static validation.
- **Source/exports** - Typecheck/behavior plus consumer checks for imports/exports/shared types/values.
- **Tooling** - Exercise accepted/rejected inputs and fixes through the tool; types do not prove diagnostics.
- **Generated contracts** - Regenerate from source and verify every affected consumer, not only producer.
- **Cross-boundary behavior** - Verify each owning seam and available end-to-end/real interface; types do not prove runtime behavior.
- **Release configuration** - Parse changed JSON/YAML; inspect native inputs/outputs/publication gates at owners. Follow Releasing. Offline checks cannot establish hosted readiness.
- **External/opt-in** - Credentials, services, retained data, deployment, destructive setup, and live checks require explicit authorization, configured access, and established prerequisites; stop if unresolved.

For difficult bugs, establish failing feedback; implement behavior changes in public-seam red-green slices. Review standards and originating specification before closeout. Installed workflows support but do not replace obligations or authorize commits. Follow observability contracts without unowned logging.

### Pull Request Operations

Follow [shared PR requirements](../CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests) even where the template omits prompts. Audit against the actual PR base, not feature upstream. Draft/final-review operations require corresponding authorization; remove draft status only after final-review requirements pass. Release dispatch/publication require separate explicit authorization under Releasing.

### Closeout

Account for every outcome, changed file, runtime/interface, persisted/generated artifact, and documentation owner against implementation/verification evidence. Continue selected checks until passing or concretely blocked. Report exact current-session commands and observed exit status/outcome; otherwise `Not run`.

For each skipped/blocked check, report reason, missing prerequisites, and exact safe next action/recovery. For uncovered seams, name the seam, strongest evidence, and owning package without inventing commands. Completion requires every outcome accounted for and every applicable check passing or a reported blocker with safe recovery.
